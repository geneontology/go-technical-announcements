# Overview

The purpose of this file is to give GO developers an idea on how they might contact
groups or resources that they believe are using GO technical products--API and automated download usage.

# Contacting (possibly make the below as specif as possible for your target user)

Dear GO User,

We wanted to let you know that we are now offering a centralized location for GO technical announcements and community discussion at:
https://github.com/geneontology/go-technical-announcements/issues .

Announcements (issues) on this repository will be concerned with:

- releases and changes for GO widgets
- changes to the GO API
- format and layout changes for GO data downloads

For users of our widgets, API, or downloads, we _highly_ recommend following this repository, as it will be the main communication channel
and the best way to get informed of upcoming changes or outages.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us at our Helpdesk at https://github.com/geneontology/helpdesk/issues or help@geneontology.org .

Best,

<<NAME>>
The GO Software Team
